Overview
========
This webpage contains descriptions of the nost_tools library features, and
provides a detailed description of its functions. Within this library, there are
templates to support both time-managed and time-agnostic applications.

These templates allow a user to create an application with unique functionality,
and easily ensure that the application will be compatible with the simulation as
a whole.

In this webpage, you can find the documentation for the provided templates, as
well as several :ref:`example cases<Example Case Documentation>` showing the templates integrated
into a user application.

The tools library is an expansion of the NOS-T testbed infrastructure project, intended to simplify
component interoperability for distributed systems testing. Read more about the NOS-T project in
:ref:`the project section<What Is NOS-T?>`
