NOS Testbed (NOS-T) Documentation
=================================

Welcome to the documentation for the New Observing Strategies Testbed (NOS-T)
===========================================================================

The New Observing Strategies Testbed (NOS-T) is a comprehensive digital engineering environment
designed to develop, test, mature, and socialize new operating concepts and technology for
NASA's New Observing Strategies initiative. NOS-T provides a framework for scientists, engineers,
and mission planners to model, simulate, and analyze novel observational approaches across various
space science disciplines.

Key Capabilities
---------------

* **Simulation Environment**: Test new observing strategies in realistic scenarios
* **Digital Twin Integration**: Connect with high-fidelity models of spacecraft and instruments
* **Collaborative Platform**: Share and build upon concepts across NASA centers and partners
* **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly develop and evaluate new observation techniques
* **Performance Analysis**: Quantitatively assess strategy effectiveness and efficiency

Who Should Use NOS-T?
--------------------

* Scientists developing new observation strategies for space missions
* Engineers designing spacecraft systems and instruments
* Mission planners optimizing science return and resource utilization
* Researchers evaluating observation trade-offs and capabilities
* Program managers assessing technology readiness and performance metrics
