Getting Started with NOS-T
==========================

This section contains instructions on how to get started with running
tests over the NOS-T infrastructure. It is based around two sets of example
codes.

The Science Event Dashboard is a simple test case which publishes 
utility scores to a dashboard. It is comprised of just two applications
and is a good place to start. For documentation, please see: :ref:`instructionsScienceDash`.

Finally, the FireSat+ test suite is based on the familiar FireSat, which 
is a running example throughout the classic space systems text, *Space Mission Analysis and Design*. FireSat+ uses 
the NOS-T Tools Library and is a good entry point for more-capable experiments:

* The applications can be found in `the NOS-T Tools GitHub repository <https://github.com/code-lab-org/nost-tools/tree/main/nost_tools>`__.
* The most basic instructions for running FireSat+ are found here: :ref:`instructionsFireSat`. 
* A deeper dive into the applications and code is here: :ref:`fireSatExampleTop`.
* The Interface Control Document has a high-level description of FireSat+ here: :ref:`ICDfireSat`.
* The NOS-T Tools documentation is here: :ref:`nostTools`.
