Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
===============================

This section addresses common questions about the NOS Testbed (NOS-T).

General Questions
---------------

What is NOS-T?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NOS-T (New Observing Strategies Testbed) is a digital engineering environment developed by NASA to facilitate the development, testing, and evaluation of new observing strategies for space missions.

Who can use NOS-T?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NOS-T is available to NASA personnel, contractors, academic partners, and other authorized users working on relevant projects. Contact the NOS-T team for access information.

Is NOS-T open source?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Parts of the NOS-T toolkit are open source. Please refer to the repository license for specific details on usage and distribution.

Technical Questions
-----------------

What computing resources are required?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NOS-T can run on standard workstations for basic simulations. More complex modeling may require high-performance computing resources. See the installation guide for specific requirements.

Can NOS-T interface with other simulation tools?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes, NOS-T is designed with an interoperability framework that allows integration with various external tools and models. See the API documentation for details.

How do I add my own mission models?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Custom mission models can be integrated using the plugin architecture. Follow the examples in the `examples/custom_models` directory and refer to the developer guide.

Troubleshooting
-------------

Simulation crashes with memory error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This typically occurs when running complex scenarios on insufficient hardware. Try reducing the simulation fidelity or using a machine with more RAM.

Cannot connect to distributed simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Check your network configuration and firewall settings. The distributed simulation features require specific ports to be open. See the network configuration guide.
