Getting Started with NOS-T
==========================

This section contains instructions on how to install the NOS-T tools library
and run basic applications over the NOS-T infrastructure.

First, you should go to the :ref:`installation guide `

`requirements file <https://github.com/code-lab-org/nost-tools/blob/main/docs/requirements.txt>`__.

The most basic example code is the Science Dashboard. It has just two applications
and doesn't require use of the NOS-T tools library. Instructions for running this test case
can be found here: :ref:`instructionsScienceDash`.
