Getting Started with NOS-T
==========================

This section contains instructions on how to install the NOS-T tools library
and run basic tests over the NOS-T infrastructure.

The most basic example code is the Science Dashboard. It has just two applications
and doesn't require use of the NOS-T tools library. Instructions for running this test case
can be found here: :ref:`instructionsScienceDash`.
