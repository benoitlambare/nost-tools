Release Documents
=================

The links below will lead you to some official release documents. 
The Interface Control Document (ICD) is an in-depth look at the NOS-T
system architecture, the MQTT message protocol, unmanaged/managed
use cases, and a detailed starting guide.

The Technical Brief contains similar information to the ICD but in a more
concise format. 

If you're just getting started with NOS-T, a shorter beginner's guide
can be found here :ref:`getStarted`
