Development Workflow
===================

This document outlines the recommended workflow for developing features and fixes for the NOS-T project.

Version Control Workflow
----------------------

We follow a standard GitHub flow for development:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Begin by forking the main NOS-T repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Create a Branch**: Create a branch in your fork for your contribution:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
      # or 
      git checkout -b fix/issue-you-are-fixing

   Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your changes.

3. **Make Your Changes**: Develop your contribution following our coding standards.

4. **Commit Your Changes**: Make commits that are logical, atomic units of change:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"

   Follow these commit message guidelines:
   
   * Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   * Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
   * Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
   * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

5. **Push to Your Fork**:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      git push origin feature/your-feature-name

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a pull request from your branch to the main NOS-T repository.

Development Cycle
--------------

1. **Issue Tracking**: All features and bugs should be tracked in our GitHub issue tracker.

2. **Design**: For significant features, create a design document or proposal first and seek feedback.

3. **Implementation**: Develop your changes with attention to maintainability and performance.

4. **Testing**:
   * Write unit tests for all new functionality
   * Update existing tests as needed
   * Ensure all tests pass locally before submitting
   * aim for 80%+ code coverage for new code

5. **Documentation**:
   * Update API documentation for any changed interfaces
   * Add or update user guides as appropriate
   * Include examples for new features

6. **Code Review**: All code changes undergo peer review through pull requests.

7. **Continuous Integration**: Changes must pass all automated CI checks.

8. **Merge**: After approval and passing tests, a maintainer will merge your contribution.

Branching Strategy
----------------

* `main` - Contains the latest stable release
* `develop` - Integration branch for features and fixes
* `feature/*` - For new features and enhancements
* `fix/*` - For bug fixes
* `release/*` - For preparing new releases

Release Process
------------

1. **Version Bump**: Update version numbers in appropriate files
2. **Changelog**: Update the changelog with notable changes
3. **Testing**: Perform final verification of all features and fixes
4. **Documentation**: Ensure all documentation is updated
5. **Release**: Tag the release and publish artifacts
6. **Announce**: Communicate the release to stakeholders

Tips for Efficient Development
---------------------------

* Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository
* Use virtual environments for isolated dependency management
* Run tests frequently during development
* Consider using pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
* Keep pull requests focused on a single concern for easier review
