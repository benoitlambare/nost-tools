Example Test Suites
===================

These three example test suites demonstrate both managed and unmanaged application use cases.
Descriptions of the each node is found via the links below. 

The Science Event Dashboard application is a simple example with only two applications. a
step-by-step guide for using this example is found here: :ref:`instructionsScienceDash`

FireSat+ is a more complex and capable use case. It integrates the NOS-T tools library. There
is a step-by-step guide for running this test suite here :ref:`instructionsFireSat`

Finally, the Scalability test suite was used to test how well NOS-T can handle messages
loads of varying frequency and size.
