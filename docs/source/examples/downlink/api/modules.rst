Ground Station Network Test Suite: Example Applications
=======================================================

This test suite is derivative from the `FireSat+` test suite. The :obj:`SatelliteStorage` application contains similar methods as the :ref:`Constellation application from the FireSat+ example<fireSatConstellations>` but with additional internal states tracked for each satellite in the constellation. Documentation of the manager application in this test suite is omitted since it is similar to the example in the FireSat+ test suite.
