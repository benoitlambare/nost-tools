What Is NOS-T?
==============

NOS-T is a systems engineering testbed designed to organize and execute distributed missions.
Using the widely available Solace message broker, the testbed features several levels of interactions that leverage a
manager component, responsible for time simulation, with user-defined applications, to generate an effective means
for the user to easily and iteratively create and explore test cases.
